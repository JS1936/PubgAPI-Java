Sending Request to Pubg API (Making a Request)

In order to learn about a match, you need to request its data.

Requirements:
-Gaming platform is steam
-Player's name will be provided by the user
-As of November 2022, the user may only provide one player name per request

Abilities:
-Store results of request (if valid: match_ids based on 1 player's activity within the last 14 days) in a .txt file
-The results of a request can be used to access and analyze telemetry for individual matches
-Once you have the telemetry for a match, you can repeatedly investigate that match without making another request
