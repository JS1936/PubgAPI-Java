## Pubg-API-Java ##

## Purpose ## 
This project started because I wanted to know how many bots were in the pubg games I played. Upon seeing what the telemetry data looked like, I realized there were a lot of other statistics I could learn about, too. 

## Functionalities ##
Currently, the Pubg-API-Java project has the following primary functionalities:

| WHAT      |   HOW   | WHERE |
|---------- | ------- | ----- |
