If the preset already exists, then what?
May be easier to name the presets such that they are more easily findable by name. (EX: number).
Then read through the file.

Create a folder.
    Where: in .../requestsDir/custom/<player_name>/<timestamp>
    (Or .../<player_name>_custom/...
    Essentially the same as naming a different folder...

Attempt to add each active file to the folder.
If a file does not exist or is invalid, do not include it. Error message.
If a file exists and is valid, add it to the folder. Note: add, not move.

Once the folder is set up, do the actions.
Consider: specific results-file for that request, stored in folder.
(This would be in addition to an overall results-file, for every request)


Read through the file

To do a custom selection of match files, copy these files and put them in a folder.
Tell the program where to find the folder.
